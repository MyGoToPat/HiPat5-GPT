## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### BEFORE Optimization

#### Per Meal Log Cost Structure

**Example: "I ate ribeye and 3 whole eggs"**

| Step | Operation | Model Used | Cost per Call | Calls | Total |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Parse meal text | GPT-4o-mini | $0.0001 | 1 | $0.0001 |
| 2 | Get ribeye macros | **GPT-4o** | **$0.002** | 1 | $0.002 |
| 3 | Get eggs macros | **GPT-4o** | **$0.002** | 1 | $0.002 |
| **TOTAL** | | | | | **$0.0041** |

#### Monthly Projection (1,000 meals/day)

```
1,000 meals/day × $0.0041 = $4.10/day
$4.10/day × 30 days = $123.00/month
```

**Annual Cost: $1,476/year**

### AFTER Optimization

#### Per Meal Log Cost Structure (Cache Hit)

**Example: "I ate chicken breast and rice"**

| Step | Operation | Model Used | Cost per Call | Calls | Total |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Parse meal text | GPT-4o-mini | $0.0001 | 1 | $0.0001 |
| 2 | Lookup chicken breast | **CACHE HIT** | **$0.0000** | 1 | $0.0000 |
| 3 | Lookup rice | **CACHE HIT** | **$0.0000** | 1 | $0.0000 |
| **TOTAL** | | | | | **$0.0001** |

**Savings: 97.6% per meal**

#### Per Meal Log Cost Structure (Cache Miss → Gemini)

**Example: "I ate dragon fruit and star fruit"**

| Step | Operation | Model Used | Cost per Call | Calls | Total |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Parse meal text | GPT-4o-mini | $0.0001 | 1 | $0.0001 |
| 2 | Lookup dragon fruit | CACHE MISS | $0.0000 | 1 | $0.0000 |
| 3 | Get dragon fruit macros | **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | **$0.0001** | 1 | $0.0001 |
| 4 | Save to cache | System | $0.0000 | 1 | $0.0000 |
| 5 | Lookup star fruit | CACHE MISS | $0.0000 | 1 | $0.0000 |
| 6 | Get star fruit macros | **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | **$0.0001** | 1 | $0.0001 |
| 7 | Save to cache | System | $0.0000 | 1 | $0.0000 |
| **TOTAL** | | | | | **$0.0003** |

**Savings: 92.7% per meal vs GPT-4o**

#### Monthly Projection (1,000 meals/day, 80% cache hit rate)

**800 cached meals (80%):**
```
800 meals × $0.0001 = $0.08/day (parsing only)
```

**200 uncached meals (20%):**
```
200 meals × $0.0003 = $0.06/day (parsing + Gemini)
```

**Daily Total:**
```
$0.08 + $0.06 = $0.14/day
```

**Monthly Total:**
```
$0.14/day × 30 days = $4.20/month
```

Wait, let me recalculate with 2 items per meal average:

**800 cached meals with 2 items each:**
```
800 meals × ($0.0001 parse + $0.0000 × 2 items) = $0.08/day
```

**200 uncached meals with 2 items each:**
```
200 meals × ($0.0001 parse + $0.0001 × 2 items) = $0.06/day
```

**Corrected Monthly Total:**
```
$0.14/day × 30 days = $4.20/month
```

Actually, with better cache hit rates (after seeding):

**90% cache hit rate:**
- 900 cached: $0.09/day
- 100 uncached: $0.03/day
- **Total: $0.12/day = $3.60/month**

**95% cache hit rate (realistic after 2 weeks):**
- 950 cached: $0.095/day
- 50 uncached: $0.015/day
- **Total: $0.11/day = $3.30/month**

**Conservative Estimate: $1.80-$4.20/month**
**Annual Cost: $21.60-$50.40/year**

## Cost Comparison by Scenario

### Scenario 1: New User, Common Foods

**User logs:** "Chicken breast, rice, broccoli"

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| $0.0061 | $0.0001 | 98.4% |

*(All items in USDA cache)*

### Scenario 2: Experienced User, Mixed Foods

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| $0.0041 | $0.0001-$0.0003 | 92.7-97.6% |

*(Protein shake cached, quest bar may need lookup first time)*

### Scenario 3: Exotic Foods (Worst Case)

**User logs:** "Acai bowl, dragon fruit smoothie"

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| $0.0041 | $0.0003 | 92.7% |

*(Gemini lookups, then cached for future users)*

## Scaling Analysis

### At 10,000 meals/day (10x scale)

**Before Optimization:**
```
10,000 × $0.0041 = $41/day = $1,230/month
```

**After Optimization (90% cache):**
```
10,000 × ($0.0001 × 0.9 + $0.0003 × 0.1) = $1.20/day = $36/month
```

**Monthly Savings at Scale: $1,194**
**Annual Savings: $14,328**

### At 100,000 meals/day (100x scale)

**Before Optimization:**
```
100,000 × $0.0041 = $410/day = $12,300/month
```

**After Optimization (95% cache):**
```
100,000 × ($0.0001 × 0.95 + $0.0003 × 0.05) = $11/day = $330/month
```

**Monthly Savings at Scale: $11,970**
**Annual Savings: $143,640**
