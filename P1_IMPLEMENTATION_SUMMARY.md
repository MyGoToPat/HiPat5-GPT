# P1 Implementation Summary: Admin & Filters

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Phase:** P1 - Swarm Response Pipeline with Admin UI and Dietary Filters
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration: `20251016_p1_admin_and_filters.sql`)

Created 6 new tables with full RLS and service-role-only access:

#### Core Tables
- **`swarms`**: Swarm configuration (id, name, description, default_model, enabled)
- **`agent_prompts`**: Versioned agent prompts with draft/published status, phase assignment, execution order
- **`swarm_agents`**: Junction table linking swarms to agent prompts with phase/order
- **`swarm_versions`**: Version control with draft/published/archived states and rollout percentage
- **`agent_test_runs`**: Test execution results with input/output, metrics, latency
- **`dietary_filter_rules`**: Filter rules by type (keto, low_carb, carnivore, allergen) with conditions

#### User Preferences Extensions
Added 4 new columns to `user_preferences`:
- `diet_type` (text): balanced, keto, low_carb, carnivore
- `macro_overrides` (jsonb): Custom macro adjustments
- `allergens` (jsonb array): User allergen list
- `religious_restrictions` (jsonb array): Dietary restrictions

#### Utility Functions
- `publish_swarm_version(uuid)`: Atomically publish version and archive previous
- `get_active_swarm_manifest(text)`: Fetch published manifest for a swarm

#### Security
- RLS enabled on all config tables
- Service-role-only policies (no public access)
- Indexes for performance: agent_id+phase+exec_order, swarm_id+status
- Triggers for automatic updated_at timestamp management

#### Seeded Data
- Keto filter rule (20g carb max)
- Low-carb filter rule (100g carb max)
- Carnivore filter rule (animal-based only)

### 2. Admin UI Components

#### `SwarmsPageEnhanced.tsx`
- **Feature flag gating**: Auto-enabled for admin users via `swarmsV2Admin` flag
  - Checks admin status on mount using `isAdmin()` + `getFeatureFlags()`
  - Displays "Access Restricted" message for non-admins
  - Dev override: Set `VITE_SWARMS_V2_ADMIN=true` in local .env
- **API Health Check button**: Tests `/functions/v1/swarm-admin-api/health` endpoint
  - Shows spinner while checking
  - Displays OK/Error status with icons
  - Confirms service-role connectivity
- Swarm list with selection (left panel)
- **Manifest editor** with:
  - JSON validation on save
  - Red border + inline error message if invalid
  - Example structure in placeholder
- Version management (draft → publish at 0%)
- **Rollout controls**:
  - Percentage slider (0-100%)
  - Cohort selector (beta/paid/all)
  - Active rollout banner showing current state
- Test Runner launcher (green button)
- All features default to 0% rollout (no user impact)

#### `TestRunnerModal.tsx`
- **"Bypass Persona Filters (Override)" checkbox**:
  - Passes `personaOverride: boolean` to `FilterPipeline.applyAll()`
  - When checked: Column 2 shows no annotations (filters bypassed)
  - Orange "Override Active" badge when enabled
  - Allows testing both filtered and unfiltered states
- 4-column pipeline visualization:
  1. Raw ResponseObject (JSON)
  2. Filter annotations (warnings, substitutions) - suppressed if override active
  3. Presenter output (formatted text)
  4. Final render (with persona)
- Metrics display: total/filter/presenter/render latency, token usage
- Save test case to `agent_test_runs` table with metadata
- All list renders use stable keys (no React warnings)

#### Enhanced Renderer (`renderer.ts`)
- Consumes published manifests from `get_active_swarm_manifest()`
- Validates protected fields against mutations
- Renders filter annotations (error/warning/info levels)
- Async compose() method for manifest fetching
- Info-level issues now displayed separately

---

### 3. Filter Phase Infrastructure

#### `filters.ts` - Dietary Filter System
- **Abstract `DietaryFilter`** base class with immutable payload enforcement
- **`KetoFilter`**: Checks total carbs against rule threshold, flags high-carb items
- **`LowCarbFilter`**: Configurable carb limit enforcement
- **`CarnivoreFilter`**: Detects plant-based foods, suggests animal alternatives
- **`AllergenFilter`**: Matches allergens from user preferences against meal items
- **`FilterPipeline`**: Orchestrates all filters, reads from DB, respects `persona_override`

#### Filter Results Structure
```typescript
{
  annotations: [{ field, message, severity: 'info'|'warning'|'error' }],
  substitutions: [{ original, suggested, reason }],
  warnings: ['⚠️ Keto Alert: ...']
}
```

---

### 4. Store Layer (`swarms.ts`)

Complete state management for P1 features:
- `fetchSwarms()`, `fetchAgentPrompts()`, `fetchSwarmVersions()`
- `createAgentPrompt()`, `updateAgentPrompt()`, `publishAgentPrompt()`
- `createSwarmVersion()`, `publishSwarmVersion()`, `updateRolloutPercent()`
- `createTestRun()`, `getActiveManifest()`
- Optimistic updates for UI responsiveness

---

## Feature Flags & Rollout Controls

All new features are **behind flags** and **default to 0% rollout**:

1. **Draft Versions**: Created but not published (no impact)
2. **Published @ 0%**: Live in DB but gated by rollout_percent
3. **Rollout Slider**: Admin can increment 0% → 5% → 10% → 100%
4. **Cohort Gating**: (Planned) Beta/Paid/All user filtering

**Current State**: No end-user impact until rollout > 0%

## Verification Steps

### Database Verification (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)

Execute queries in `VERIFICATION_QUERIES_P1.sql`:

1. ✅ All 6 tables created
2. ✅ RLS enabled on all config tables
3. ✅ Policies exist (service_role only)
4. ✅ 3 dietary rules seeded (keto, low_carb, carnivore)
5. ✅ 4 new columns in user_preferences
6. ✅ `publish_swarm_version()` function works
7. ✅ `get_active_swarm_manifest()` returns manifest
8. ✅ Indexes created for performance
9. ✅ Triggers installed for updated_at

**Screenshot each query result** and confirm expected values.

### Application Verification

1. **Admin Access**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/swarms-enhanced` (new page)
   - See swarms list (empty if none created)

2. **Create Draft Version**:
   - Click "Create Draft" on a swarm
   - Edit JSON manifest
   - Save draft (status: draft, rollout: 0%)

3. **Test Runner**:
   - Click "Test Runner" button
   - Enter meal description: "grilled chicken with rice and broccoli"
   - Click "Run Test"
   - Verify 4-column output with filter annotations
   - Confirm metrics displayed (latency, tokens)

4. **Publish Version**:
   - Click "Publish @ 0%" on draft version
   - Confirm publish dialog
   - Verify version status changes to "published"
   - Verify rollout stays at 0%

5. **Rollout Control**:
   - Move slider from 0% to any value
   - Click "Update"
   - Verify rollout percentage updated
   - **(Current)** No user impact regardless of percentage (wiring needed in production pipeline)

6. **Filter Testing**:
   - Create user with `diet_type = 'keto'` in user_preferences
   - Run Test Runner with high-carb meal (e.g., "pasta with bread")
   - Verify filter annotations appear: "⚠️ Keto Alert: Xg carbs exceeds 20g limit"
   - Set `persona_override = true` in test
   - Verify no dietary annotations generated

## Known Limitations

1. **Rollout % Not Wired**: Percentage saved but not enforced in runtime (P4)
2. **Test Runner Mocked**: Uses mock ResponseObject instead of live pipeline
3. **No Drag-Drop**: Agent order set via numeric input (P2)
4. **No Diff Viewer**: Manual JSON comparison only (P3)
5. **Service-Role Access**: Requires service_role key for admin operations (by design)
