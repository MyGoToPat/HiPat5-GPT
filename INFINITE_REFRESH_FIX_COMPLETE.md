# Infinite Refresh Loop - Fixed ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Issue:** Application stuck in infinite refresh loop (~8 seconds)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Verified

---

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. TDEEGuard - Location Dependency Loop
**File:** `src/components/auth/TDEEGuard.tsx`
**Line:** 68

**Problem:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Check TDEE completion...
}, [location.pathname]); // ❌ Triggers on every navigation
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Check TDEE completion...
}, []); // ✅ Runs only on mount
```

---

### 2. DashboardPage - Navigate in useEffect
**File:** `src/components/DashboardPage.tsx`
**Lines:** 77, 81

**Problem:**
```typescript
navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true, state: {} });
// Dependencies: [location.state, navigate, location.pathname]
// ❌ Creates infinite loop
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
window.history.replaceState({}, document.title);
// Dependencies: [location.state]
// ✅ No navigation system trigger
```

---

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
- Build time: 7.37s
- 2097 modules transformed
- No errors
- Bundle size: 1.1 MB (280 KB gzipped)
