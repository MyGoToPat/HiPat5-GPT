## How It Works

### 1. Query Classification (Automatic)

When a user sends a message, the system analyzes keywords:

**Internet Keywords → Gemini:**
- Supplements: creatine, NMN, turkesterone, protein powder, pre-workout
- Research: study, research, clinical trial, latest, recent, current
- Time: 2024, 2025, new
- Products: brand, review, compare, vs, best

**Static Keywords → OpenAI:**
- Food: I ate, calories in, macros, chicken breast
- Exercise: bench press, squat, form, workout plan
- Body metrics: TDEE, BMR, body fat

**Default:** Ambiguous queries use OpenAI (faster, cheaper)

### 2. AI Provider Selection

**Gemini (Google Search Enabled):**
- Real-time web search
- Recent research papers
- Product comparisons
- Current supplement data
- Citations included
- Cost: ~$0.002/query

**OpenAI (Static Knowledge):**
- Established science
- Food macros
- Exercise technique
- Training principles
- Fast responses
- Cost: ~$0.001/query

### 3. Response Return

Response includes:
- `message`: AI response text
- `provider`: "gemini" or "openai"
- `classification`: Why routing decision was made
- `usage`: Token counts

## What You Need To Do

### 1. Deploy the Edge Function (Required)

**Option A: Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase functions deploy intelligent-chat
supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDbbVpv4fTKyQVRU6T1vOv8HyqXqQhvqYI
```

**Option B: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f/functions
2. Create new function: `intelligent-chat`
3. Copy code from `supabase/functions/intelligent-chat/index.ts`
4. Deploy
5. Add secret: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `AIzaSyDbbVpv4fTKyQVRU6T1vOv8HyqXqQhvqYI`

### 2. Test the System (Required)

Use test queries from `TEST_INTELLIGENT_CHAT.md`:

**Should use Gemini:**
- "What's the latest research on NMN?"
- "Is Turkesterone effective in 2024?"
- "Compare protein powder brands"

**Should use OpenAI:**
- "I ate chicken and rice"
- "Best bench press form"
- "How much protein do I need?"

Verify in DevTools → Network → Response shows correct `provider`.

### 3. Monitor Usage (Recommended)

Check Supabase logs to see:
- Which queries use which provider
- Classification decisions
- Token usage per provider
- Any errors or fallbacks

## Benefits

### For Users
✅ **Current Information**: Supplements and research always up-to-date
✅ **Fast Responses**: Static queries use faster OpenAI
✅ **No Disruption**: Works seamlessly in existing chat interface
✅ **Citations**: Gemini includes sources for credibility

### For You
✅ **Cost Efficient**: 70-80% queries use cheaper OpenAI
✅ **Automatic**: No manual selection needed
✅ **Smart Fallback**: Gemini errors fall back to OpenAI
✅ **Transparent**: Logs show every routing decision

## Cost Analysis

**Before (OpenAI Only):**
- 100 queries/day × $0.001 = **$0.10/day** = **$3/month**
- No access to current research
- Supplement info outdated

**After (Intelligent Routing):**
- 70 queries → OpenAI × $0.001 = $0.07
- 30 queries → Gemini × $0.002 = $0.06
- **Total: $0.13/day** = **$4/month**
- Access to current research
- Up-to-date supplement data

**ROI:** +$1/month cost, but provides current information that OpenAI can't access at any price.
