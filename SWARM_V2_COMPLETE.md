**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING
**Build:** ✅ Successful (no errors)

---

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

All 8 phases of Swarm 2.2 have been successfully implemented and integrated. The system is ready for gradual rollout with feature flag control.

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Schema & Data ✅
- ✅ `20251011000002_add_idempotency_key.sql` - Prevents duplicate logs
- ✅ `20251011000003_add_food_defaults.sql` - Canonical food reference
- ✅ `20251011000004_seed_food_defaults.sql` - 40+ common foods seeded
- ✅ `20251011000005_standardize_totals_kcal.sql` - Single source of truth
- ✅ `20251011000006_add_user_prefs_feature_flags.sql` - Per-user overrides
- ✅ `20251011000007_ensure_meal_items_numeric_precision.sql` - Full decimal precision

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/cache/questionCache.ts` - Hybrid cache (memory + localStorage)
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/idempotency.ts` - SHA-256 fingerprinting
- ✅ `src/lib/telemetry/events.ts` - Structured event logging
- ✅ `src/lib/featureFlags.ts` - Feature flag system with rollout control

### Phase 3: Intent Layer ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/personality/intentClassifier.v2.ts` - Pure classification (no extraction)

### Phase 4: Food Swarms ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/nlu.ts` - Entity extraction
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/resolver.ts` - Nutrition lookup (cache → defaults → LLM)
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/aggregator.ts` - Pure math with 4/4/9 reconciliation
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/validator.ts` - Quality checks
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/questionSwarm.ts` - Read-only food questions
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/timeParser.ts` - Timezone-aware time extraction
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/logger.ts` - Idempotent database writer
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/mentionSwarm.ts` - Food logging orchestrator
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/food/undoSwarm.ts` - Last meal deletion

### Phase 5: Other Swarms ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/swarms/kpi/remainingSwarm.ts` - "How much left today?" calculator

### Phase 6: Personality Layer ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/personality/dataFormatter.ts` - Deterministic formatting (no LLM)
- ✅ `src/lib/personality/toneShaper.ts` - Optional polish with numeric lock

### Phase 7: Orchestrator ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/personality/orchestrator.v2.ts` - New pipeline with telemetry

### Phase 8: Integration ✅
- ✅ `src/components/ChatPat.tsx` - Feature flag routing to Swarm 2.2
- ✅ Legacy path preserved for rollback safety
- ✅ Build successful (no errors)

---

## 📊 Architecture Confirmation

All architectural requirements from your confirmation document have been implemented:

1. ✅ **Legacy path preserved** - Feature flag with per-user override
2. ✅ **No numeric drift** - Structured responses skip final LLM call (`skipLLM` flag)
3. ✅ **Single intent classifier** - Old foodClassifier.ts remains but unused
4. ✅ **Idempotency** - SHA-256 hash + unique index + dedupe logic
5. ✅ **Assumption banner** - Shows cooked/raw/size assumptions with correction hints
6. ✅ **Rounding policy** - Store full precision (NUMERIC), round only for display
7. ✅ **Timezone awareness** - From user_preferences, computed once per request
8. ✅ **Minimal schema v1** - Only essential migrations
9. ✅ **Dashboard accuracy** - Meal breakdown matches stored totals (4/4/9 rule)

---

## 🚀 Rollout Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy at 0% (All Users Disabled)

```bash
# Set environment variable (default)
VITE_SWARM_V2_ROLLOUT_PCT=0

# Deploy to production
npm run build
# ... deploy dist/ folder
```

### Step 2: Enable for Test Users

```sql
-- Enable Swarm 2.2 for specific test user
UPDATE user_preferences
SET feature_flags = jsonb_set(
  COALESCE(feature_flags, '{}'::jsonb),
  '{swarm_v2_enabled}',
  'true'::jsonb
)
WHERE user_id = '<test-user-id>';
```

Or use the helper function from code:

```typescript
import { enableSwarmV2ForUser } from './lib/featureFlags';
await enableSwarmV2ForUser('<test-user-id>');
```

### Step 3: Test Core Flows

1. **Food Question:** "what are the macros of 10oz ribeye?"
   - Expected: Detailed breakdown with assumption banner
   - Expected: "Say 'log' to save this meal" CTA

2. **Log Follow-up:** "log"
   - Expected: Meal logged with confirmation
   - Expected: No duplicate if typed twice

3. **Food Mention:** "I ate 3 eggs and bacon for breakfast"
   - Expected: Meal logged immediately
   - Expected: Dashboard shows new meal

4. **KPI Query:** "how much left today?"
   - Expected: Remaining macros with percentage

5. **Undo:** "undo last meal"
   - Expected: Last meal deleted
   - Expected: Dashboard updated

### Step 4: Gradual Rollout

```bash
# 5% rollout
VITE_SWARM_V2_ROLLOUT_PCT=5

# Monitor for 1 week, check:
# - Error rates (telemetry)
# - Dashboard accuracy
# - User feedback

# 25% rollout
VITE_SWARM_V2_ROLLOUT_PCT=25

# 50% rollout
VITE_SWARM_V2_ROLLOUT_PCT=50

# 100% rollout (after 4 weeks)
VITE_SWARM_V2_ROLLOUT_PCT=100
```

### Step 5: Clean Up Legacy Code (After 100% Rollout)

After Swarm 2.2 has been at 100% for 2+ weeks with no issues:

1. Remove old `classifyFoodMessage` block from ChatPat.tsx (lines 618-667)
2. Delete `src/lib/personality/foodClassifier.ts`
3. Rename `.v2.ts` files:
   - `intentClassifier.v2.ts` → `intentClassifier.ts`
   - `orchestrator.v2.ts` → `orchestrator.ts`
4. Remove feature flag checks from ChatPat.tsx (always use Swarm 2.2)

## 🔍 Console Debugging

When Swarm 2.2 is enabled, you'll see:

```
[ChatPat] Using Swarm 2.2 (feature flag enabled)
[telemetry:intent] { type: "intent_classified", duration: "42ms", ... }
[telemetry:format] { type: "response_formatted", duration: "18ms", ... }
[telemetry:store] { type: "meal_logged", duration: "156ms", ... }
```

When disabled (legacy path):

```
[ChatPat] Using legacy path (Swarm 2.2 disabled)
[ChatPat] Food mention detected, logging meal...
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Before production rollout, verify:

- [ ] Feature flag routing works (enable/disable for test user)
- [ ] Food questions return structured responses
- [ ] "log" follow-up works without duplicates
- [ ] Food mentions log immediately
- [ ] KPI queries show remaining macros
- [ ] Undo deletes last meal (within 24h)
- [ ] Dashboard totals match meal_logs.totals
- [ ] Assumption banner shows for cooked-by-default items
- [ ] Typing "log" twice doesn't create duplicate (idempotency)
- [ ] Numbers in responses are never changed by tone shaper
- [ ] Timezone-aware "today" bounds work correctly
- [ ] Fiber tracking works (if item has fiber)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User metrics not found"
**Cause:** User hasn't completed TDEE onboarding
**Fix:** Complete TDEE wizard first

### Issue: "No recent food question to log"
**Cause:** Cache expired (5min TTL) or no prior question
**Fix:** Ask food question first, then say "log" within 5 minutes

### Issue: Duplicate meals despite idempotency
**Cause:** Different timestamps (>30s apart)
**Fix:** Expected behavior - idempotency has 30s window

### Issue: Numbers changed in response
**Cause:** Tone shaper modified numbers
**Fix:** Check logs for `[toneShaper] Numbers changed!` warning - should never happen

### Issue: Dashboard shows wrong totals
**Cause:** Meal logged before reconciliation or migration not run
**Fix:** Re-run `20251011000005_standardize_totals_kcal.sql` migration

## 📈 Telemetry Monitoring

After enabling for users, monitor:

1. **Pipeline Duration** - Should be <2s for most requests
2. **LLM Call Count** - Should be 1-2 for food questions, 0 for structured responses
3. **Error Rate** - Should be <1%
4. **Idempotency Hit Rate** - Track `isDuplicate: true` percentage
5. **Cache Hit Rate** - Track "log" follow-ups vs new questions

Example telemetry output:

```json
{
  "totalDuration": 1842,
  "stageCount": {
    "intent": 1,
    "format": 1,
    "store": 1
  },
  "llmCalls": 1,
  "errors": 0
}
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After 2 weeks at 100%:

- ✅ Zero duplicate meal logs (idempotency working)
- ✅ Dashboard totals match meal_logs.totals (4/4/9 rule enforced)
- ✅ Average response time <2s
- ✅ Error rate <1%
- ✅ User feedback positive
- ✅ No numeric drift detected
