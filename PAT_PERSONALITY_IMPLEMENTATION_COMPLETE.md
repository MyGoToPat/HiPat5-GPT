# Pat's Personality System - Implementation Complete

## What Was Done

Successfully replaced the 13-agent system with Pat's new personality system featuring **11 specialized agents** that are fully controllable through the Admin UI.

## New Agent System

### Core System (3 agents)
1. **Master Prompt** - Pat's base personality and identity
2. **Context Checker** - Detects missing TDEE, first-time users
3. **Role Detector** - Pattern matching for specialized modes

### Specialized Experts (4 agents)
4. **TMWYA Expert** - Food logging specialist
5. **MMB Expert** - Support/feedback specialist
6. **Fitness Coach** - Training specialist
7. **Nutrition Planner** - Meal planning specialist

### Response Enhancers (4 agents)
8. **Evidence Validator** - Adds research citations
9. **Clarity Enforcer** - Simplifies complex language
10. **Conciseness Filter** - Removes fluff words
11. **Actionizer** - Adds clear next steps

## How to Use

### View Agents
1. Navigate to **Admin > Agents**
2. Click on **"Pat's Personality"** tab
3. You'll see all 11 agents with their current settings

### Control Each Agent
- **Toggle On/Off**: Enable or disable any agent
- **Edit Instructions**: Modify the agent's system prompt
- **Edit Template**: Change how messages are formatted
- **Adjust Model Settings**: Change temperature, max tokens, etc.
- **Reorder**: Change execution order

### Examples of What You Can Do

**Don't like TDEE reminders?**
- Disable "Context Checker"
- Pat will stop checking user status
