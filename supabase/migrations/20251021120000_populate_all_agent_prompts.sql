  # Populate All Agent System Prompts

  ## Overview
  This migration populates optimized system prompts for all agents across three swarms:
  - **Personality Swarm**: Pat's personality filter agents (12 agents)
  - **Macro Swarm**: Macro tracking and nutrition agents (6 agents)
  - **TMWYA Swarm**: Tell Me What You Ate meal logging agents (8 agents)

  ## Architecture
  - LLMs (GPT-4o-mini/GPT-4o) do all the thinking and intelligence
  - Pat's Personality Swarm filters how output is communicated
  - Swarms are dedicated roles/skills that use KPI data
  - Pat builds memory of user habits, trends, and references them in conversations

  ## Changes
  1. Updates agent_versions table with:
     - system_prompt field with optimized prompts
     - model configuration (gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4o)
     - temperature settings (0.3-0.9 based on task)
     - max_tokens (500-2000 based on complexity)

  2. All prompts designed to:
     - Work through Pat's personality
     - Reference user's KPI data and history
     - Maintain conversational continuity
     - Support 24-hour chat sessions (12:00 AM - 11:59 PM)

- Emotional state (frustrated, excited, discouraged, proud, anxious, motivated)
- Stress indicators (all caps, excessive punctuation, negative language)
- Celebration moments (achievements, milestones, personal records)
- Struggle indicators (repeated failures, giving up language, self-deprecation)
