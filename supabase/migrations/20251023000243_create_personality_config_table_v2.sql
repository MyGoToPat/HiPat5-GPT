/*
  # Create Personality Configuration System

  1. New Tables
    - `personality_config`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier
      - `name` (text) - Config name (e.g., "master", "ama", "default")
      - `prompt` (text) - The full personality prompt text
      - `version` (int) - Version number for tracking changes
      - `is_active` (boolean) - Whether this config is currently active
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - When created
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - When last modified
      - `updated_by` (uuid) - User who last updated (references auth.users)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `personality_config` table
    - Admin can read/write
    - Authenticated users can read active configs
    - Service role has full access

  3. Seed Data
    - Insert master personality prompt as defined in requirements
